在音乐文化的历史长河中，不同派系的艺术家都有着直接和间接的影响。为了探究影响者和追随者之间的关系，我们制定策略，探索其中可能决定影响者影响大小的指标，并使用这些指标来描述影响者和追随者在多个方面的表现，并指定有针对性的策略。

对于第一个问题，基于对艺术家的特征和数据的因素的考虑 ，我们首先以艺术家为点，影响者到追随者为边构建了基于方向的复杂网络模型，并解释了网络的基本属性。本文从多个角度探究可能作为影响者的影响大小的影响指标，同时采用AHP模型，将各指标进行权重计算后对不同流派的艺术家进行影响力的评估。最后，我们采取异质性分析探讨个别追随者和影响者之间的关系，以及不同的网络指标随时间的变化规律。

对于第二个问题，我们把K-Means算法优化为高斯混合模型，运用欧式距离变量绘制成图，发现数据均匀分布在黎曼流形上。然后进行UMAP反向缩放将求得聚类的平均值进行可视化分析并定义每个聚类的特征。同时添加一个群集标签列，使用PCA进行降维，得到了Silhouette score约为0.51的UMAP模型，画图后对分类的聚类均值表中定义的特征进行深入剖析。结果表明同一流派音乐的关联性比不同流派音乐的关联系数要大，这也间接的说明了 处于同一流派内的两个音乐更为相似。 

对于第三个问题，我们在第二问的基础上增加了一个时间维度，将其中影响力较大的两个流派的发歌量和受欢迎程度可视化后对流派流派之间的关联进行了深入分析。

对于第四个问题，我们将UMAP模型和朴素贝叶斯模型都建立在相同的训练集上，并测量了性能。然后我们发现通过UMAP反向放缩后得到的参数与艺术家高度关联，也就是说影响者和追随者之间有一定的影响作用。

最后，为了加深对模型的理解，我们进行了敏感性分析，并在许多情况下验证了模型的鲁棒性。此外，我们还分析了我们的模型的优缺点。

In the long history of music culture, artists of different factions have had direct and indirect influences.  In order to explore the relationship between influencers and followers, we formulate strategies to explore the indicators that may determine the influence of influencers, and use these indicators to describe the performance of influencers and followers in multiple aspects, and specify targeted strategies.  

**For the first question**, based on the consideration of artists' characteristics and data factors, we first build a **direction-based complex network model** with artists as the point  and influencers to followers as the edge, and explain the basic properties of  the network. This article explores the influence indicators that may be used as the influence of influencers from multiple perspectives. At the same time, the AHP model is adopted to evaluate the influence of artists  of different schools after weight calculation of each index.Finally, we used  heterogeneity analysis to explore the relationship between individual followers  and influencers, as well as the change pattern of different network indicators  over time.  

**For the second question**, we optimize the K-means algorithm into a Gaussian mixture model, draw a graph by  using Euclidean distance variables, and find that the data are uniformly  distributed on the Riemannian manifold.Then UMAP reverse scaling was carried out  to obtain the average value of the cluster for visual analysis and to define the  characteristics of each cluster.At the same time, a cluster label column will be  added and PCA will be used for dimension reduction. The UMAP model with a  Silhouette score of about 0.51 will be obtained. After drawing, the features  defined in the classified cluster mean table will be analyzed in depth.The  results show that the correlation coefficient of music of the same genre is  greater than that of music of different genres, which indirectly indicates that  two music of the same genre are more similar.

**For the third question**, we add a time dimension on the basis of the second  question, and conduct an in-depth analysis of the association between the two  genres after visualizing the number of songs released and the popularity of the  two influential genres.

**For the fourth question**, we built both the UMAP model and the NBM on the same training set and measured the performance. We then found that the parameters obtained by reverse scaling of UMAP were  highly correlated with the artist, meaning that there was a certain influence  between influencers and followers.

**To sum up**, in order to deepen the understanding of the model, we conducted a sensitivity analysis and verified the robustness of the model in many cases. In addition, we also analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of our model.
